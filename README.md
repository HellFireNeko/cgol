# Conways Game Of Life!
This was a fun little side project, where i implemented the logic for conways game of life in Rust using Amethyst for rendering.

## How to simulate this:
- Press `space` to start or pause the simulation
- Press `m` to perform a single step (this also pauses the simulation)
- Press `i` to reinit the tiles
- Use `wasd` to move the camera
- Press `pageup` to zoom in, `pagedown` to zoom out
- Press `escape` to close
